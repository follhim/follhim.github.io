I take a multilevel approach, examining these dynamics at internal, interpersonal, and institutional levels.\nI seek to develop innovative measurement tools that capture the unique RS experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, ensuring these instruments work effectively across diverse sexual, gender, racial, and religious groups.\nI am currently engaged in efforts to model RS-health pathways through which adverse/beneficial RS experiences may contribute to psychological or behavioral health.\nFinally, as part of my commitment to translational research, I hope to collaborate with religious organizations to develop empirically-supported, culturally-responsive resources and training protocols that enhance the capacity of religious leaders, institutions, and families to effectively support LGBTQ+ individuals."

    "text": "One of the most common, and yet painstaking, tasks in writing a manuscript is creating a table (correlation, regression, etc.).\nCreating them by hand is not only time-consuming but also error-prone. Even when some softwares (SPSS) allow users to create tables, they are often not APA7 ready.\nToday, I introduce a simple package called {apaTables} that will prepare an APA7 ready correlation table (the most commonly reported APA table) in 3 steps AND less than 5 minutes!\nNote\nThis assumes that you have basic familiarity with R."
