We identified four patterns of engagement, suggesting higher religious engagement is tied to lower mental distress but higher internalized stigma. In summary, we find religious engagement is tied to both health benefits and risks.\n\n\nPresentation\nTo view the presentation file, please see below.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Materials\nTo view all reproducible materials (e.g., code, data), please see the github repository below."

I take a multilevel approach, examining these dynamics at internal, interpersonal, and institutional levels.\n\nI seek to develop innovative measurement tools that capture the unique RS experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, ensuring these instruments work effectively across diverse sexual, gender, racial, and religious groups.\nI am currently engaged in efforts to model RS-health pathways through which adverse/beneficial RS experiences may contribute to psychological or behavioral health.\nFinally, as part of my commitment to translational research, I hope to collaborate with religious organizations to develop empirically-supported, culturally-responsive resources and training protocols that enhance the capacity of religious leaders, institutions, and families to effectively support LGBTQ+ individuals."

    "text": "Education & Training\nPrior to beginning his doctoral studies, Seungju earned his B.A. in Psychology magna cum laude from Wheaton College, where he completed an honors thesis examining psychological well-being in religious mixed-orientation marriages during his junior year. His research training began as a freshman working with Dr. Sandra Rueger, before joining Dr. Mark Yarhouse at the Sexuality and Gender Identity Institute, where he contributed to a national study investigating the complex intersection of faith and LGBTQ+ identities.\nExpanding his research training before his senior year, Seungju established significant external collaborations with leading researchers. At Utah State University, he worked with Dr. Tyler Lefevor examining the effects of religiousness and spirituality on LGBTQ+ mental health, where he developed skills in psychometric scale development and validation using R’s {psych} and {lavaan} packages.\nSimultaneously, Seungju joined Dr. David Wang at Fuller Theological Seminary, analyzing longitudinal data from a $1.9 million study on spiritual formation. This collaboration strengthened his experience in sophisticated longitudinal modeling using R and Mplus, examining complex patterns of change over time.\nHis quantitative methodological expertise was further enhanced when he was selected for the competitive NSF-REU Health Equity summer internship at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Working with Drs. Katie Edwards and Lorey Wheeler on multiple NIH-funded studies examining LGBTQ+ youth and emerging adults, Seungju gained advanced skills for identifying mischievous responders in survey data, regression models, and scale development. He was later recruited as a post-bac research associate at the UNL methodology and psychometrics center.\nBefore entering graduate school, Seungju was awarded the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, among one of the only awardees at Wheaton."

    "text": "Typically, when we run a linear regression in R, we will use the lm() function. And while the lm() will get most jobs done, it has several limitations:\n\nIt cannot handle missing data.\nIt does not have maximum likelihood estimators built in.\n\nThis is in contrast to Mplus which has both of these features, with capabilities for a host of estimators (e.g., maximum likelihood with robust standard errors) and the ability to handle missing data using full information maximum likelihood estimator.\nWell the great news is that you too can do this in R using the lavaan package. Finally, often times I hear that people have a hard time plotting simple slopes using lavaan, but I will be going over a very helpful function to help us!\nLet’s begin!"
