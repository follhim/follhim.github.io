## Research Interests

My research explores the intersection of religiosity/spirituality (RS) and mental health in LGBTQ+ populations, with special attention to communities of color. I take a multilevel approach, examining these dynamics at internal, interpersonal, and institutional levels.

I seek to develop innovative measurement tools that capture the unique RS experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, ensuring these instruments work effectively across diverse sexual, gender, racial, and religious groups.

I am currently engaged in efforts to investigate both the pathways through which negative RS experiences may contribute to psychological distress and behavioral health, and how certain RS practices foster resilience and wellbeing.

Finally, as part of my commitment to translational research, I hope to collaborate with religious organizations to develop empirically-supported, culturally-responsive resources and training protocols that enhance the capacity of religious leaders, institutions, and families to effectively support LGBTQ+ individuals.
