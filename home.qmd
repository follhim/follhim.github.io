My name is Seungju Kim[^1] and thank you for visiting my personal website detailing my research interests and work! 

I am a **National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow** and first-year PhD student in Clinical/Community Psychology Program at the **University of Illinois** under Dr. Nathan Todd. 

My research is focused on modeling the relationship between **religiosity/spirituality (RS)** and **psychological/behavioral health** in historically marginalized communities.

## Research Interests

My research explores the intersection of religiosity/spirituality (RS) and mental health in LGBTQ+ populations, with special attention to communities of color. I take a multilevel approach, examining these dynamics at internal, interpersonal, and institutional levels.

I seek to develop **innovative measurement tools** that capture the unique RS experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, ensuring these instruments work effectively across diverse sexual, gender, racial, and religious groups.

I am currently engaged in efforts to **model RS-health pathways** through which adverse/beneficial RS experiences may contribute to psychological or behavioral health.

Finally, as part of my commitment to **translational research**, I hope to collaborate with religious organizations to develop empirically-supported, culturally-responsive resources and training protocols that enhance the capacity of religious leaders, institutions, and families to effectively support LGBTQ+ individuals.
