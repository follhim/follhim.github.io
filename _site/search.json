    "text": "One of the most common, and yet painstaking, tasks in writing a manuscript is creating a table (correlation, regression, etc.).\nCreating them by hand is not only time-consuming but also error-prone. Even when some softwares (SPSS) allow users to create tables, they are often not APA7 ready.\nToday, I introduce a simple package called {apaTables} that will prepare an APA7 ready correlation table (the most commonly reported APA table) in 3 steps AND less than 5 minutes!\nNote\nThis assumes that you have basic familiarity with R."

While researchers have embraced online collaboration tools like Google Docs for writing, R statistical work often remains stuck in the email-and-file-sharing era.\nIn this guide, I will be providing my case for a 2025 R-stats workflow by introducing new and easy ways to streamline your research project, collaborations, and dissemination.\n\n\n\nQuick Workflow (5 min): With only RStudio, you will learn how to render your analyses into an online webpage that is easy to share with others, and can be updated at any time, reducing the need to share any files.\nBasic Workflow (15 min): Using Github, we can build upon the Quick workflow by generating the webpages on Github. The benefit? By rendering on Github pages you will retain the history of every update you make to the webpage. This is a life-saving feature as you will inevitibly need to go back to find code you previously deleted or changed.\nBest Workflow (20 min): In this approach, you will learn how most of Computer Science/Engineering folks tackle collaborations. Full utilization of Github! In this approach, you will learn to “push” each udpate you make in your analyses to Github which will save all new changes in your “project” space all the while generating a webpage.\n\n\n\n\nThis guide covers two essential GitHub workflows for R users:\n\nGithub account\nRStudio (& by implication R programming)"

This is a life-saving feature as you will inevitibly need to go back to find code you previously deleted or changed.\nBest Workflow (20 min): In this approach, you will learn how most of Computer Science/Engineering folks tackle collaborations. Full utilization of Github! In this approach, you will learn to “push” each udpate you make in your analyses to Github which will save all new changes in your “project” space all the while generating a webpage."

If yes, then you only have one step left. If it did not render, then you need to examine the error. Note, that depending on what package you use, an output that shows on your Desktop RStudio may not show in an HTML output.\nI would recommend refering to an R expert or what most people do these days: ask ChatGPT/Claude.\n\nFinally, go to the terminal tab inside RStudio. Where is the terminal tab located? If you have your Rstudio set conventionally, then its in the bottom section (not top or right section). There are three tabs: Console, Terminal, and Background jobs. Type the following into the terminal:\n\nquarto publish quarto-pub FILENAME.qmd\nThen hit enter/return.\nIt will ask you to authenticate, sign in with your Quarto Pub account.
