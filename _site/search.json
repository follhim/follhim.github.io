Even when some softwares (SPSS) allow users to create tables, they are often not APA7 ready.\nToday, I introduce a simple package called {apaTables} that will prepare an APA7 ready correlation table (the most commonly reported APA table) in 3 steps AND less than 5 minutes!\nNote\nThis assumes that you have basic familiarity with R."
